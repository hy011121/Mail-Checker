## Mail Checker Info

**This script functions to check whether an email is connected to various social media platforms:**

* **Twitter:** This script uses the Twitter API to check whether the email is registered and available for creating a new account.
* **Instagram:** This script attempts to send an Instagram account recovery email to the provided email address. If the email is connected to an Instagram account, there will usually be a message mentioning sending a recovery email.

**Ways of working:**

1. The script asks the user to enter an email address.
2. Script to check email availability for Twitter.
3. The script tries to send an Instagram account recovery email to the entered email.
4. The script displays results for each platform, stating whether the email is connected ("Linked") or not connected ("Unlinked").

**Important to Note:**

* This script uses web scraping and may violate social media platform policies.
* This script is not secure and is not recommended for use on personal emails.
* The checking section for Snapchat no longer works because the API used is no longer valid.

While these scripts may be interesting for learning, it is important to be aware of their potential risks and functional limitations before use.
